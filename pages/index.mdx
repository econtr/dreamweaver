# About Page

Hi! I’m a UC Merced graduate with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
I’m passionate about software development and always looking to learn and grow.
Lately, I’ve been focusing on improving my skills in web development and exploring new creative interests along the way.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and watching movies, along with a multitude of other hobbies.
I’ve also worked on a variety of creative projects, some of which you can check out here on my website!
