# About Page

Hi! I'm a current 4th year student attending UC Merced, studying computer science and engineering. 
I am passionate about software development and am always looking to learn new things. 
I am currently working to improve my skills in web development and am looking to learn more about various different things that interest me.

Other than programming, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and watching movies, apart from a multutide of other hobbies.
