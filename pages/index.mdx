# About Page
Hi! I'm a recent graduate from UC Merced, where I studied computer science and engineering. 
I am passionate about software development and am always looking to learn new things. 
I am currently working to improve my skills in web development and eager to explore more new interests.

Beyond programming, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and watching movies, apart from a multutide of other hobbies. 
I have other creative projects that I've worked on, that you might see here on my website!
