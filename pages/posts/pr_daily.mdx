# Updating a Local News Website

import Image from "next/image";

Local journalism matters. And in an era where so much is moving online,
I saw an opportunity to help a small local news site by making it more accessible and
adaptable to today's digital landscape, while also learning new skills as a developer. 
This project wasn't part of a job or a class, 
it was just something I cared about. I wanted to give back to the
community and grow in the process.

The main goal that I wanted to achieve was improving on the current site that exists.
The current site is a WordPress based news site, which feels cluttered.
Lots of content vying for attention of the user.

There exists also a mobile version of the website as well when accessed on a phone.

  <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    <Image
      src="/images/pr_photo2.jpg"
      alt="Photo"
      width={300}
      height={500}
      className="next-image"
      style={{ margin: "0 auto", display: "inline-block" }}
    />
    <Image
      src="/images/pr_photo7.jpg"
      alt="Photo"
      width={300}
      height={500}
      className="next-image"
      style={{ margin: "0 aut", display: "inline-block" }}
    />

Although less clunky in comparison to its desktop counterpart, the UI is a bit outdated for today.

I focused on improving both the user experience and the tech stack.
Here are some of the key updates:

- **From the Ground Up**: Designed and developed the site layout and article pages for both desktop and mobile
- **Modern Stack**: Used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for fast performance and SEO-friendly routing.
- **PWA Support**: Rather than creating a native app, I added [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
  features so users can install the site to their home screens and use it offline.
- **Sanity CMS Integration**: I chose [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) as the content management system so that non-technical contributors could easily post and manage their own stories. It was recommended as a flexible, user-friendly platform, and it worked out great.
- **Responsive & Accessible Design**: The site is mobile-first and designed with accessibility and performance in mind.

The site is now more responsive and accessible, and it's easier to maintain. As
well as being more user-friendly, with an accessible web app that can be installed
on a user's home screen!
